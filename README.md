| **No Surveillance** | Zero logs. No ads. No tracking. You own your data. |
| **Unblockable** | AI rotates IPs, spoofs fingerprints — Netflix, Disney, BBC, all yours |
| **Personal** | "You like sci-fi? Here's free Star Trek from Canada. Or paid HBO from US — your call." |
| **Fair** | Open-source. No paywalls for the tool. Revenue from recommendations only |

## **HOW IT WORKS — THE TRUTH**

1. **You say:** "AIVPN, find me free The Office"  
2. **AI scans:** 200+ countries, legal free streams (YouTube, public TV)  
3. **AI suggests:** "Available free in UK. Connect?"  
4. **Connects:** Unblocks + spoofs location  
5. **If paid:** "Netflix US has it for $15.99 — or free ad-supported on Pluto TV?"  
6. **Companies pay:** To appear in "paid" — but **free is always first**

---

## **ETHICS — THE FOUNDATION**

- **No illegal streams** — Only legal, free content  
- **Transparency:** "This recommendation paid $0.01 — free option above"  
- **User control:** "I decide what to watch, not the AI"  
- **Privacy:** No watch history shared without consent  
- **Fair pay:** Companies bid, but no auctions — flat rate for visibility
